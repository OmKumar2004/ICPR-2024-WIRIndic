=> Our solution employs a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) for multilingual scene text recognition. The model architecture combines convolutional layers for feature extraction and LSTM layers for sequence prediction, for effective handling of both the spatial and sequential aspects of text in images.

=> The approach includes data preprocessing with image augmentation and normalization, as well as label encoding for each language. The CRNN model uses multiple convolutional layers with max-pooling, followed by LSTM layers to capture the sequential nature of text.

=> Training utilizes the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss function for sequence prediction tasks with unknown input-output alignments.

=> Models were trained on all the different given languages with above-average results.
